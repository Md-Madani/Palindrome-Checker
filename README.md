# Palindrome-Checker
A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.

Key Features of a Palindrome:

The sequence must be symmetrical, meaning it remains identical when reversed.

## Palindromes can be:

1. Words: Single words that are the same forwards and backwards.
2. Phrases: Phrases where spaces, punctuation, and case are ignored.
3. Numbers: Numerical sequences that are the same forwards and backwards.

## Examples:

### Words:

"madam"
"racecar"
"level"
"rotor"

### Phrases (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and case):

"A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!"
"Was it a car or a cat I saw?"
"No 'x' in Nixon"
"Eva, can I see bees in a cave?"

### Numbers:

121
12321
909

## Palindrome Rules:

1. Exact symmetry: The sequence should be identical whether read from left to right or right to left.
2. Case and space insensitivity: In the case of phrases, spaces, punctuation, and capital letters are ignored.
   
Example: "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!" is considered a palindrome because, if you remove spaces and punctuation, and convert everything to lowercase, it becomes "amanaplanacanalpanama", which is the same forwards and backwards.
